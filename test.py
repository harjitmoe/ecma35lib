# By HarJIT in 2019.

# DONE:
# - Tokenisation of ECMA-35 streams with DOCS-integrated ISO 10646 streams.
# - Processing of UTF-8 sections to codepoints.
# - Processing of UTF-16 sections to codepoints.
# - Processing of UTF-32 sections to codepoints.
# - Opcoding C0 and C1 control characters.
# - Opcoding the fixed controls.
# - Parsing designator sequences.
# - Invocation processing (i.e. resolving GL/GR tokens to G0/G1/G2/G3).
# - Graphical set processing.
# - Some sort of output.
# STILL TO DO:
# - More graphical sets.
# - Rich or annotated output of some sort.
# - Composition sequences (Hangul ones, also backspace ones).
# - CSI and (ideally) CEX sequences. CSI sequences are open-access in ECMA-48, and fairly well
#   documented besides, so they should be doable. CEX sequences are defined in JIS C 6225 a.k.a.
#   JIS X 0207, which is withdrawn and also not open-access (ISO-IR-74 gives only a vague overview,
#   which could just as validly apply to CSI), so likely unattainable.
#   - Documentation for an implementation of CEX is available here, actually (doesn't seem to be
#     all the codes, and those it includes are not in enough detail to understand arg format):
#     http://printronix.com/wp-content/uploads/manuals/PTX_PRM_OKI_N7_256482A.pdf
# - Processing of UTF-1 sections to codepoints.
# - More control sets.
# - Announcements, and some means of verifying them.
