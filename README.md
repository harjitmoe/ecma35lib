An experimental implementation of ECMA-35 (correspending to ISO/IEC 2022, JIS X 0202) aspiring to
support the mechanisms defined by it and related specifications (ECMA-6, ECMA-43, ECMA-48 and 
others) in their entirety, even those which are not supposed to be used together.

I do not claim conformance with any standard: where standards are named, this is by way of sourcing
a specification consulted and/or identifying a format codified by that specification, and should
not be taken as a claim of compliance.

# Warnings

This is intended to serve an experimental and potentially educational purpose; it is not expected
to become anything which is sensible to include in production.

ECMA-35 has the inherent property that it is basically impossible to sanitise a text in the full 
encoding system (as opposed to a secure subset). Please do not use this facing the internet. If 
you do, it's on you, but don't say I didn't warn you precisely why you shouldn't.

Also, this has not been professionally vetted for security and may contain security-relevant 
bugs. The complexity compared to restricted code versions such as ISO-8859-7, EUC-JP or even 
ISO-2022-JP only makes this all the more likely. This is another very good reason not to use this 
implementation facing the internet.

# Carried out

- Tokenisation of ECMA-35 streams with DOCS-integrated ISO 10646 streams.
- Processing of UTF-8 sections to codepoints.
- Processing of UTF-16 sections to codepoints.
- Processing of UTF-32 sections to codepoints.
- Processing of UTF-1 sections to codepoints (not thoroughly tested).
- Processing of SCSU sections to codepoints (not thoroughly tested).
- Opcoding C0 and C1 control characters.
- Opcoding the fixed controls.
- Parsing designator sequences.
- Invocation processing (i.e. resolving GL/GR tokens to G0/G1/G2/G3).
- Graphical set processing.
- Some sort of output.
- Mnemonic parsing for CSI sequences, and CEX sequences for which I can get enough info.
- Hangul composition sequences.
- IRR codes.

# Still to do

- More graphical sets.
- Support for Big-5 as a DOCS set.
- Support for general extended ASCII (i.e. with only the LHS following ECMA-35), e.g. Windows-1252.
- Dynamically allocating sets, IRR codes, DOCS codes (e.g. Shift_JIS) in some configurable way.
- Proper handling of the T.51 / T.61 and ANSEL combining sequences. Probably don't need to stick to
  any hardcoded repertoire though, since (a) we're not trying to implement ISO/IEC 6937, but rather
  T.51 (which confines the entire ISO 6937 repertoire definition (rather than just one of the 
  charts as in ISO/IEC 6937) to an annex which isn't referenced from the main text), and (b) we're 
  mapping to ISO/IEC 10646, not to ISO/IEC 10367 or 8859, so combining marks aren't a problem.
- Functionality of CSI, CEX, C1 _et cetera_ controls.
  - Rich or annotated output of some sort.
- Backspace composition sequences; some handling of the GCC CSI with respect to Unicode.
- Figure out how the relevant parts of Videotex work:
  - The rest of the control sets.
  - The rest of the DOCS codes.
- Announcements, and some means of verifying them. Preferably by generating ERROR tokens.
- Some sort of encoder.
- Some sort of decent API for using it from outside.
