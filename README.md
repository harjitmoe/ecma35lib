An experimental implementation of ECMA-35 (correspending to ISO/IEC 2022, JIS X 0202) aspiring to
support the mechanisms defined by it and related specifications (ECMA-6, ECMA-43, ECMA-48 and 
others) in their entirety, even those which are not supposed to be used together.

I do not claim conformance with any standard: where standards are named, this is by way of sourcing
a specification consulted and/or identifying a format codified by that specification, and should
not be taken as a claim of compliance.

# Warnings

This is intended to serve an experimental and potentially educational purpose; it is not expected
to become anything which is sensible to include in production.

ECMA-35 has the inherent property that it is basically impossible to sanitise a text in the full 
encoding system (as opposed to a secure subset). Please do not use this facing the internet. If 
you do, it's on you, but don't say I didn't warn you precisely why you shouldn't.

Also, this has not been professionally vetted for security and may contain security-relevant 
bugs. The complexity compared to restricted code versions such as ISO-8859-7, EUC-JP or even 
ISO-2022-JP only makes this all the more likely. This is another very good reason not to use this 
implementation facing the internet.

# Structure

The `ecma35` package contains the library itself. The `data` subpackage contains mapping data for
the various variants of the various sets to Unicode (for graphical sets) or mnemonics (for control
code sets). It also contains code for previewing and comparing these data. It includes mapping
data for most of the two-byte codes (except for Blissymbolics, which lacks a Unicode representation
whatsoever), and for several common one-byte codes, but there are many one-byte codes which it does
not currently support.

The `decoder` subpackage contains code for decoding the ECMA-35 stream. However, it also includes
code for handling other formats which conform only partially, or not at all, to ECMA-35. Several of
these are available using ECMA-35 DOCS sequences: for instance, it includes decoders for UTF-8,
UTF-16, SCSU and Shift\_JIS. The decoder is implemented using a stack of generator functions, all
with access to a common state.

An `encoder` subpackage is to be expected to be much more involved. It is not clear what an encoder
for the entirety of ECMA-35, leave alone the other DOCS filters, would look like: generally
speaking, an encoder is written for a particular code version / subset of ECMA-35.

Currently, `test.py` runs a test on the `decoder` subpackage. It writes its output to stdout;
however, I'm usually directing its output to `out.txt` as a manner of rudimentary regression
testing: if a change makes `out.txt` differ from its previous Git revision, this could be
indicative of an introduced problem. Its test input is highly artificial, and makes use of several
features which would not usually be used in the same document.

The scripts `genjiscmp.py` and `gencnscmp.py` use only the `data` subpackage. They generate HTML
comparison files for JIS (X 0208 / X 0212 / X 0213) and CNS 11643 in various vendor versions,
editions and mapping variations. See [CNS comparison](https://harjit.moe/cns-conc.html), 
[JIS comparison](https://harjit.moe/jis-conc.html).

# Private assignments (incomplete)

## Separate coding systems:

|Private assignment|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`DOCS 0`|Shift\_JIS. Actually a frontend on an equivalent EUC-JP model, so variant can be thereby customised.|
|`DOCS 1`|Unified Hangul Code. Also supports the KPS equivalent.|
|`DOCS 2`|GBK (including GB 18030 surrogates).|
|`DOCS 3`|"Plain extended ASCII", i.e. without `0x80-0x9F` as a control character range.|
|`DOCS 4`|Big Five (lead byte range `0x81-0xFE`)|
|`DOCS 5`|Big Five (lead byte range `0xA1-0xFC`)|
|`DOCS 6`|HangulTalk|
|`DOCS / 5`|Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode (SCSU). Was previously `DOCS / 0`; changed to avoid conflict with use of `DOCS / 0` by X11 Compound Text.|

## "Plain extended ASCII" mode

Plain extended ASCII mode is switched to by `DOCS 3` as 
mentioned above.&ensp;Once inside, [the DEC-defined DECSPPCS control
sequence](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECSPPCS.html) (i.e. `CSI ‚Ä¶ * p`) is
used for switching between numbered code pages (e.g. `CSI 1 2 5 2 * p`).&ensp;Numbers above 65535
are used for custom purposes.&ensp;Specifically:

|Private assignment|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`ESC [ 9 9 7 0 0 0 * p`|Switch to the VPS encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 7 0 0 1 * p`|Switch to the TCVN (ABC, .VN, VSCII; not VISCII) encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 7 0 0 2 * p`|Switch to the VISCII (not VSCII) encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 8 0 0 0 * p`|Switch to the Zapf Dingbats encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 9 0 0 0 * p`|Switch to the Webdings encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 9 0 0 1 * p`|Switch to the Wingdings encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 9 0 0 2 * p`|Switch to the Wingdings 2 encoding.|
|`ESC [ 9 9 9 0 0 3 * p`|Switch to the Wingdings 3 encoding.|

.. Pending are VNI-Mac, VNI-DOS, SP-Tiberian (modified Michigan-Claremont), Bee Fonts

G-sets can still be used on the left-hand side of the code page (the mode is mostly business as
usual as far as ECMA-35's 7-bit mechanisms are concerned, the only difference is the extra 128
graphical codes which are not governed by ECMA-35, since it does not use ECMA-35's 8-bit
mechanisms).&ensp;G-sets and the GL invocation are reset by the DECSPPCS sequence, however; the
defaults can vary with code page (the default is usually GL=G0=ASCII, for example, whereas 1252
also includes the GR of ISO-8859-1 as its G1 set for fairly obvious reasons).

Hence, by default, all C0 control codes will continue to work as normal.&ensp;However, the 
following sequences can be used to change this (note: this is based on [DEC's approach](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECSDPT.html)&rpar;:

|Private assignment|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`ESC [ ) p`|Reset to implementation default behaviour (in this case, the same as `ESC [ 3 ) p`).|
|`ESC [ 1 ) p`|C0 and C1 control codes work as normal (note: previously incorrectly implemented same as `ESC [ 3 ) p`).|
|`ESC [ 2 ) p`|C0 and C1 control codes work as normal (note: previously incorrectly implemented like the current `ESC [ 5 ) p`).|
|`ESC [ 3 ) p`|C0 control codes work as normal.|
|`ESC [ 4 ) p`|C0 codes are almost all graphical characters, the sole exception being ESC so that reversal is possible.|
|`ESC [ 5 ) p`|C0 codes are mostly interpreted as graphical characters, except for BEL, BS, HT, LF, CR and ESC.|

# Carried out

- Tokenisation of ECMA-35 streams with DOCS-integrated ISO 10646 streams.
- Processing of UTF-8 sections to codepoints.
- Processing of UTF-16 sections to codepoints.
- Processing of UTF-32 sections to codepoints.
- Processing of UTF-1 sections to codepoints (not thoroughly tested).
- Processing of SCSU sections to codepoints (not thoroughly tested).
- Opcoding C0 and C1 control characters.
- Opcoding the fixed controls.
- Parsing designator sequences.
- Invocation processing (i.e. resolving GL/GR tokens to G0/G1/G2/G3).
- Graphical set processing.
- Some sort of output.
- Mnemonic parsing for CSI sequences, and CEX sequences for which I can get enough info.
- Hangul composition sequences.
- IRR codes.
- Support for general extended ASCII (i.e. only the LHS follows ECMA-35) as a DOCS set.
- Support for Big5 as a DOCS set, including both incompatible maps of the Kana/Cyrillic.
- Support for GCC CSI sequences
- Proper handling of the T.51 / T.61 and ANSEL combining sequences. Not sticking to any hardcoded
  repertoire though, since (a) we're not trying to implement ISO/IEC 6937, but rather T.51
  (which confines the entire ISO 6937 repertoire definition (rather than just one of the charts
  as in ISO/IEC 6937) to an annex which isn't referenced from the main text), and (b) we're 
  mapping to ISO/IEC 10646, not to ISO/IEC 10367 or 8859, so combining marks aren't a problem.
- All graphical sets (besides Blissymbolics) with registered escapes.
- Backspace composition sequences.
- Support for EBCDIC as a DOCS set.

# Still to do

- More general RHS sets.
- Support for JOHAB as a DOCS set.
- Support for LMBCS as a DOCS set.
- Dynamically allocating sets, IRR codes, DOCS codes (e.g. Shift_JIS) in some configurable way.
- Functionality of CSI, CEX, C1 _et cetera_ controls.
  - Rich or annotated output of some sort.
- Figure out how the relevant parts of Videotex work:
  - The rest of the control sets.
  - The rest of the DOCS codes.
- Announcements, and some means of verifying them. Preferably by generating ERROR tokens.
- Some sort of encoder.
- Some sort of decent API for using it from outside.
