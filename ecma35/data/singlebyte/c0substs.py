# Macintosh compatibility C0 graphics
# The common C0 replacements are the device controls. Others seem to vary with version.
# Version attested in Chicago bitmaps from Mac OS 8.0 and also in KEYBOARD.TXT. Note that the 
#   assignment of the escape key symbol to the escape character will not be accessible in 
#   ecma35lib as it currently works.
# Note that KEYBOARD.TXT includes several mappings which differ, due to predating the addition of
#   the WDings repertoires (and with it, more closely matching characters) to Unicode:
#     U+21E5 (‚á•) where we have U+2B72 (‚≠≤)
#     U+21E4 (‚á§) where we have U+2B70 (‚≠∞)
#     U+21A9 (‚Ü©) where we have U+2B90 (‚Æê)
#     U+21AA (‚Ü™) where we have U+2B91 (‚Æë)
#     U+F802 (PUA) where we have U+1F589 (üñâ)
#     U+21E3 (‚á£) where we have U+2B6D (‚≠≠)
#     U+21E0 (‚á†) where we have U+2B6A (‚≠™)
#     U+21E1 (‚á°) where we have U+2B6B (‚≠´)
#     U+21E2 (‚á¢) where we have U+2B6C (‚≠¨)
# Also, note well that some treatments of the character mapped here to U+25C6 (‚óÜ) per KEYBOARD.TXT
#   closer match U+2666 (‚ô¶), see for example IBM's CPGID-1275 code chart.
