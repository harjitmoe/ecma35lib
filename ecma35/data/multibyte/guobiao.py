# Layout of GBK (per GB 18030:2005):
#   GB2312-inherited main EUC plane: [A1-FE][A1-FE], charted between:
#     DBCS 1: [A1-A9][A1-FE] (GB2312 non-hanzi)
#     DBCS PUA 1: [AA-AF][A1-FE] (U+E000 thru U+E233)
#     DBCS 2: [B0-F7][A1-FE] (GB2312 hanzi)
#     DBCS PUA 2: [F8-FE][A1-FE] (U+E234 thru U+E4C5)
#   Lowered lead byte:
#     DBCS 3: [81-A0][40-7E,80-FE] (non-GB2312 hanzi)
#   Lowered trail byte:
#     DBCS PUA 3: [A1-A7][40-7E,80-A0] (U+E4C6 thru U+E765) [A3A0 â†’ IDSP in WHATWG]
#     DBCS 5: [A8-A9][40-7E,80-A0] (non-GB2312 non-hanzi)
#     DBCS 4: [AA-FE][40-7E,80-A0] (non-GB2312 hanzi)
#
# SBCS ([00-80,FF]) is GB/T 11383 without shift codes in theory, although it's
# ASCII with a Euro sign at 0x80 in practice. Notably, the Yen sign U+00A5 is
# encoded at 0x81308436, so this is literally just GB 18030 displaying U+0024 as 
# a Yuan sign, not a difference in mapping. Why you make this so confusing?
#
# From a cursory skim, DBCS 3 seems to be walking through the URO and picking only
# the hanzi not included in DBCS 2, abruptly finishing when it runs out of space.
# DBCS 4 picks up immediately from where DBCS 3 left off, and continues this until
# 0xFD9B (U+9FA5, i.e. the last one in the "URO proper" from Unicode 1.0.1 and 2.0,
# as opposed to URO additions) as the last one following this pattern. The remaining
# row-and-a-bit is used for non-URO non-GB2312 kanji which are allocated two-byte
# codes, and are somewhat chaotic, with a mixture of mappings to PUA, CJKA, CJKCI.
